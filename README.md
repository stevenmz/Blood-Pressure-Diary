# BloodPressureDiary
This Android application was written to make it easy for people who need to track their blood pressure to do so from anywhere using their smartphone. Features of this application include: adding blood pressure readings, viewing readings in list or graph form, export of readings for sending to a health provider, and a help section that provides information on blood pressure ranges from a trusted medical source (Mayo Clinic).
